# Introduction

The doctape View API enables your applications to store, convert and host documents of your users easily and securely on doctape.

The idea is simple: Your application can store and access documents with a given email address using doctape. You and your users donâ€˜t have to care whether this particular user has a doctape account or not - you can store and access those documents anyway.

Integration is done simply by redirecting your current forms to doctape. doctape will handle all file uploads and re-post a slightly modified version of the form data to your original form target. Note that there is also a way to upload your documents via asynchronous JavaScript file uploading.
